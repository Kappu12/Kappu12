That's awesome! Here’s a fun, concise bio you could use for personal or professional introductions:

---

I'm an infrastructural engineer with a passion for creative development, especially in JavaScript. I love building whatever pops into my head—one highlight was making a ticket bot for Discord. I’ve earned a few certs and take pride in troubleshooting my own code. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me staring at the grass outside my window for hours. Not big on social media—I pretty much live under a rock.
**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, Infrastructure, and a very sturdy, noise-canceling limestone boulder.

**Current Status:** 0% social presence, 100% chance of being found in a terminal window, 10/10 grass-watching enthusiast.

**Note:** If you can't reach me, I’m not ignoring you—I’ve just successfully automated my social life into non-existence.

Let me know if you want it tweaked for a resume, LinkedIn (even if you don’t use it!), or any other context!
